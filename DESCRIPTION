Description: Data analysis requirements for the WAACHS project often involves a range of complex and nuanced functions. This is conflated by different analysts working across similar tasks at different points in time. This (local) package aims to ameliorate this with a set of functions applicable to all analysts (who use R)---aiding reproducibility.
